# TMIP-EMAT + VisionEval

!!! info "Disclaimer"

    The views expressed in this documentation do not necessarily represent the 
    opinions of FHWA, and do not constitute an endorsement, recommendation, 
    or specification by FHWA.


This documentation is for the integration of the [TMIP-EMAT](http://tmip-emat.github.io) exploratory modeling
and analysis tool with the [VisionEval](https://visioneval.github.io) strategic planning model.

For this integration, we are using VisionEval as a "core model", and wrapping it with EMAT to provide
a more robust and flexible exploratory modeling and analysis environment.

In addition to this documentation, you may also want to refer to the 
[TMIP-EMAT documentation](http://tmip-emat.github.io) and the 
[VisionEval documentation](https://visioneval.github.io).

This documentation is a companion to two example repositories:

-   [tmip-emat/tmip-emat-ve](https://github.com/tmip-emat/tmip-emat-ve) - An initial 
    technological demonstration of the integration of EMAT and VisionEval.
-   [tmip-emat/ve-integration](https://github.com/tmip-emat/ve-integration) - 
    An example of using the integration as implemented for Oregon DOT.
