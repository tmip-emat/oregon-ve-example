# TMIP-EMAT + VisionEval

!!! info "Disclaimer"

    The views expressed in this documentation do not necessarily represent the
    opinions of FHWA, and do not constitute an endorsement, recommendation,
    or specification by FHWA.

This documentation is for the integration of the [TMIP-EMAT](http://tmip-emat.github.io) exploratory modeling
and analysis tool with the [VisionEval](https://visioneval.github.io) strategic planning model.
The audience for this documentation is technically sophisticated users looking for
succinct instructions on successfully integrating TMIP-EMAT with VisionEval.
Completing such an integration requires at least a rudimentary understanding of
both tools, and it is necessary to write or edit Python code to complete the integration.

For this integration, we are using VisionEval as a "core model", and wrapping it with EMAT to provide
a more robust and flexible exploratory modeling and analysis environment.

In addition to this documentation, you may also want to refer to the
[TMIP-EMAT documentation](http://tmip-emat.github.io) and the
[VisionEval documentation](https://visioneval.github.io).

This documentation is a companion to two example repositories:

- [tmip-emat/tmip-emat-ve](https://github.com/tmip-emat/tmip-emat-ve) - An initial
    technological demonstration of the integration of EMAT and VisionEval.
- [tmip-emat/ve-integration](https://github.com/tmip-emat/ve-integration) -
    An example of using the integration as implemented for Oregon DOT.
